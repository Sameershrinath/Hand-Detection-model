# Finger Counting AI Model

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-based model capable of counting fingers in real-time through a camera feed. The model can be further integrated into applications where finger counting is a prerequisite, such as sign language interpretation, gesture recognition, or human-computer interaction.

## Features
- Real-time finger counting from camera feed.
- Integration potential with various applications requiring finger counting functionality.
- Adjustable accuracy and speed parameters to cater to different use cases.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/finger-counting-ai.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the `finger_counting.py` script:
    ```
    python finger_counting.py
    ```
2. Position your hand in front of the camera.
3. The model will detect and count the fingers in real-time.

## Configuration
- Adjust parameters such as detection threshold, frame rate, or model architecture in the `config.py` file to suit your specific requirements.
